        text: "The Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Dryobates borealis) is a species that resides primarily in mature fire-maintained pine savannas and woodlands in the southeastern United States. These woodpeckers are known for their cooperative breeding behavior, high site fidelity, and unique practice of excavating cavities almost exclusively in living mature pines. The species is currently federally endangered, with populations at the northwestern edge of its range being particularly sensitive to climate change-associated weather variations. The breeding success of these woodpeckers, including aspects like nest initiation dates and fledgling numbers, is influenced by climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation. These birds have been observed to modify their nesting behavior in response to these environmental cues, which are critical for their continued survival and adaptation in their specific habitats."
